# 📱 Helsinki Restaurant Finder (Wolt-Assignment-Jan2025)
A simple Android app built in Kotlin for a preliminary mobile engineering assignment. It displays a list of restaurants near a user’s simulated location in the Helsinki city center, updating every 10 seconds.

This app was originally submitted as part of an internship assignment, and has been included here to showcase mobile development skills using Kotlin, Jetpack components, and real-world API integration.
